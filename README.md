# ReactJS-Github_API_Info_Cards
This ReactJS Project fetches data by using Axios library from GitHub API and renders it in Info Cards
I have built a few of Simple Components in this module
**Card Component**- To Render information about Github profile
**CardList Component** - To convert an array of records into an array of card component
**Form Component**- To read inputs from the user
**App Component**- To manage the relationship between all the other Components

I have managed the record of the array as a state element on the toplevel component which allows share data between multiple components and it allows us to append new GitHub profiles to the UI by simply appending the GitHub API Response to that state element on the form component we explore how to access the element in the DOM from React Directly using the special Ref attribute and I'll have explored how to read from an input element using react state itself with the help of Onchange event component written with this latter method is known controlled components
